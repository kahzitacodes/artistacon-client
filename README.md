# Artista Con Project

This is my final project of IronHack's Web Development bootcamp.

Artista Con is a comic convention organized for independent artists to exhibit their work, similar to what happens in usual comic book events, anime, games and crafts, however it is 100% online. 

The original event was idealized by close friends of mine and happened during the pandemic of COVID-19. My intention was to recreate the online platform improving features and usability.

These conventions are essential for small and independent artists, hence the idea is to divulge web stores and projects by artists, comic artists, authors, artisans and anyone who wants to exhibit, sell or buy original products.

## Features

Each exhibitor will have its own page, with a brief description and presentation of their work and a link to their store.The general public will be able to know different artists and their products in an easy and organized way. The visitor can also save their favorite products to a list for a later purchasing.

## Tools

It is a full-stack project using ReactJS, Node.js and MongoDB and the libraries Express, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bcrypt, cors, dotenv, jsonwebtoken and axios.
